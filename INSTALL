INSTALL of FoGall

1.	Unpack files to htdocs target directory of any web server supporting PHP5
2.	Adjust settings in config.php including:
	a)	$sitename and $title to represent your own gallery (note that $title is bigger one)
	b)	$site_url as site base URL (eg. "http://example.com/my-gallery/public") 
		WITHOUT trailing slash (good: "http://example.com", bad: "http://example.com/")
	c)	$zakazane is array of files and dirs that will NOT be listed, 
		also files that are just inside listed dirnames will NOT show their content 
		(eg. you have "priv" added, and dirtree:
		/pub/
		 \_____1.jpg
		 |_____priv/
		 	    \_____dir/
		 			   \_____p1.jpg
		/priv/
		 \_____2.jpg
		 |_____apple/
		        \_____a1.png
		        |_____a2.png
		Result will be: 
			in home you will only see pub/
			in /pub/ you will only see 1.jpg, not priv/
			when you enter by hand url /priv/ you won't see any files but message like HTTP 403
			when you enter by hand url /priv/apple you will have all your files listed
3.	Do chmod on galleries/ directory to allow read&write for webserver
4.	Create htpassword file and change upload/.htaccess file
